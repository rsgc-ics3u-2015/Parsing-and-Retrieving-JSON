# JSON

 JSON is a set of rules for defining information exchange between websites.
 
 A JSON file is nothing more than a plain text file.
 
 Syntax rules for the contents of the file define the information being shared.
 
 The short version:
 
 * Data is often provided in name / value pairs (like a Dictionary in Swift)
 * Pairs are seperated by commas.
 * Curly braces hold objects (an object is a set of related pairs of data)
 * Square brackets hold arrays (an array is a list of related objects)
 
 Here is the JSON we looked at ealier:

    { "students" : [
        {
            "firstName" : "Scott",
            "lastName"  : "Blackwell"
        },
        {
            "firstName" : "Will",
            "lastName"  : "Graham"
        }
    ]}

 ## Exercise
 
 Before you move to the next page, try to identify how many objects, arrays, and name-value pairs there are in this example.
  
[Next](@next)
