 # Your turn
 
 Here is the JSON we looked at ealier:
 
    { "students" : [
        {
            "firstName" : "Scott"
            "lastName"  : "Blackwell",
        },
        {
            "firstName" : "Will",
            "lastName"  : "Graham"
        }
    ]}

 ## Exercise
 
 Use the example given and explained on the prior pages to parse the JSON structure above.
 
 Go back to page 2 if you forget what structures this JSON describes.
 
 HINTS:
 
 * When JSON contains an array, you try to cast it to a Swift array.
 * When JSON contains a dictionary (a set of name-value pairs), you try to cast it to a Swift dictionary.
 * The syntax for declaring a dictionary with a key and value that are both of type String is :
 
        let exampleDictionary : [String : String]

// Step 1: Create the JSON string.

// Step 2: Encode the string as an NSData object

// Step 3: Parse the JSON data into Swift-native data types
