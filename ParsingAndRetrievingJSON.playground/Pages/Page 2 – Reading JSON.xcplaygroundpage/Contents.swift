# Reading JSON
## Exercise – Solution
 
    { "students" : [
        {
            "firstName" : "Scott",
            "lastName"  : "Blackwell"
        },
        {
            "firstName" : "Will",
            "lastName"  : "Graham"
        },
    ]}
 
 From the top, there is a single object named *students*.
 
 The students object has a value that is an array.
 
 There are two elements in that array.
 
 Each element in the array is an object.
 
 Each element has two pairs of data.
 
 The first pair has a name of *firstName* and a value of *Scott*.
 
 The second pair has a name of *lastName* and a value of *Blackwell*.
 
 Note that the indents, or extra spaces, in the JSON example have no meaning to a computer; they just make JSON easier for human beings to read.
